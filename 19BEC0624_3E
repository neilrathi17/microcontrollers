Write a program to get a byte of hex data from P1, convert it to decimal, and then to ASCII. For example, if P1 has FBH, which is equal to 251 in decimal, after conversion we will have 32H, 35H, and 31H. Place the ASCII result in RAM locations starting at 40H. Using a simulator, single-step the program and examine the data.

               ORG 0000H

MOV P1,#0FBH

MOV R0,#40H

MOV A,P1

LOOP:    MOV B,#10

DIV AB

XCH A,B

ADD A,#30H

MOV @R0,A

XCH A,B

INC R0

JNZ LOOP

END
